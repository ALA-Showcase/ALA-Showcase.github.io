			<h4 class="ala-font mb-3">Synopsis</h4>
			<p class="mb-0">During a long-distance space voyage to a new galaxy, a lone droid dutifully maintains the human incubators, keeping the new planet settlers alive. Watching the dreams of hibernating humans makes the robot feel a deep sense of loneliness. So it crafts together a new friend from spare parts. But as things start to go wrong, the droid must make a critical decision to keep the humans alive.</p>

			<h4 class="ala-font mb-3">Description</h4>
			<p class="mb-0">‘Alone’ is a 3D animation project created by the Master of Animation and Visualisation students at the UTS Animal Logic Academy. The story idea was developed collaboratively early in the year, then the students worked in specialised departments from art, modelling, rigging, animation, previs/layout, surfacing, effects, lighting, compositing, technical direction and production coordination to complete the film in just 30 weeks of production to the highest possible industry standards.</p>

			<p class="mb-0">In the drab confines of a grey office, Gary and Carol eagerly await their afternoon respite - the coffee break. But alas, there is only one lonely doughnut left. As the clock strikes 3pm, the race for the last sugary reward ignites and Gary and Carol transform their office chairs into turbocharged racing machines. In this no-holds-barred competition, nothing is off-limits – even super-sizing your coffee. But who will claim the doughnut?</p>
